IATA Service Levels
^^^^^^^^^^
LEVELS OF SERVICE				
There are FOUR (4) Levels of Into-Plane Fuelling Service ranging from the least complex, as outlined in Level 1 requirements, to the most complex, as outlined in Level 4.				
The Fuelling Personnel will be considered to be an Authorised Refueller, qualified to operate aircraft switches to refuel aircraft, if they have successfully completed the training provided by an Approved Fuelling Instructor.				
Training will include each aircraft fleet type assigned to the station, including diversion fleet types.				
Details of the requirements are identified in the Fuelling operative Levels 1 through 4.				
				
LEVEL 1: MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE
""""""""""""""""""

A. The Fuelling Personnel of the contracted company is essentially to provide up-to plane service that includes:
			
(1) operating a fuel vehicle, making necessary nozzle connections to fuel hydrant pit and aircraft;	
		
(2) operating the deadman control.
				
B. An airline-authorised refueller will perform all other into-plane fuelling procedures and is responsible for all fuel servicing requirements.	
			
C. Level 1 service includes all the following base level procedures only:
				
(1) Have adequate knowledge of fuelling vehicle systems and operations.		
		
(2) Approach and position the fuelling vehicle at the aircraft in accordance with local and driving regulations.				

(3) Set fuelling vehicle brake and install wheel chocks if brake interlocks are not installed.		
		
(4) Bond fuelling vehicle to aircraft and ground if required.		
		
(5) Open aircraft wing fuelling panel and remove fuelling adapter caps (if installed).	
			
(6) Connect fuelling hoses to aircraft.			
	
(7) Hydrant system – connect hydrant coupler to hydrant pit valve.
				
(8) Provide fuel volume and density of fuel loaded, when requested.	
			
(9) Perform clear and bright fuel appearance checks at the aircraft in accordance with operating procedures, and perform chemical water detection test when required.				

(10) Engage and operate the deadman control under the direction and supervision of the Airline Authorised Refueller.

(11) Monitor vehicle fuelling pressures to ensure maximum limits are not exceeded.				

(12) At completion of fuelling, disconnect fuelling nozzle from aircraft, replace fuelling adapter caps (if installed) and close fuel panel access door.				

(13) Hydrant system – close hydrant pit valve and disconnect hydrant coupler.			
	
(14) Disconnect bonding cable and ground if applicable.				

(15) Provide fuel delivery receipt to representative for signature prior to aircraft departure.	
		
(16) Provide assistance when defuelling of aircraft is required.				

(17) The Fuelling Personnel has final responsibility to verify that all hoses and static grounding/bonding attachments have been disconnected from aircraft (including hydrant pit, where applicable) and are properly stowed prior to moving fuelling vehicle.				

(18) Perform walk around inspection.				
				
LEVEL 2: ROUTINE FUELLING – TOTAL FUEL REQUIRED	
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
			
A. Level 2 service includes all the items listed in level 1 plus all the items listed in the following procedures below:			

(1) Obtain documented Total fuel figure from airline representative prior to fuelling.				

(2) Perform gauge and system tests as appropriate for aircraft type.				

(3) Fuel aircraft to the Total fuel requirement using the aircraft Automatic fuelling mode as determined by an airline representative.				

(4) Complete kilo/pounds or litre/gallons conversion, when required.				

(5) Set wing panel switches and gauges and control the amount of fuel being added to the aircraft using aircraft Automatic loading settings.				

(6) Communicate with opposite wing Fuelling Operative when two fuelling vehicles are used to fuel the aircraft.				

(7) Communicate with cockpit via headphone, if required.				

(8) Monitor wing panel gauges, vehicle pressure gauges and fuel tank vents for spills during fuelling.				

(9) Deliver completed fuel service form (where supplied) to operations or cockpit crew.				
				
LEVEL 3: ROUTINE FUELLING – DISTRIBUTION REQUIRED & DISCREPANCY CHECKING				
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A. Level 3 service includes all the items listed in levels 1 & 2 plus all the items listed in the following procedures below:				

(1) Obtain Aircraft Refuel Sheet from airline or fuelling company representative prior to fuelling.				

(2) Read refuel panel gauges before and after fuelling and enter readings on to Aircraft Refuel Sheet.				

(3) Fuel aircraft per fuel uplift calculations as determined and entered on the Aircraft Refuel	Sheet.				

(4) Set refuel panel switches and gauges and control the amount of fuel being added to the aircraft using aircraft manual or automatic loading settings.				

(5) When fuelling various fleet types, be qualified to interpret Fuel Manual distribution charts and follow fuel distribution procedure in accordance with the specific fleet type.				

(6) Calculate Fuel weight in kilos/ pounds (from density) at aircraft on designated flights using hydrometer.				

(7) Calculate fuelling discrepancy and compare with maximum allowable. If it is outside limits, contact a Level 4 / Airline Authorised Refueller to check fuel levels as required.				
				
LEVEL 4: NON-ROUTINE FUELLING				
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A. At this level of service, the Fuelling Personnel of the Contracted Fuel Supplier provides full into-plane fuelling capability that includes all routine and alternate fuelling requirements for aircraft scheduled for that station.				

B. Level 4 service includes all the items listed in levels 1, 2 & 3 plus all the items listed in the following procedures below:				

(1) Be qualified to interpret Fuel Manual drip stick tables and drip stick conversion charts.				

(2) Operate and read measuring stick measurements to determine tank quantity:				

a) When requested by the Flight Crews.				

b) When quantity added exceeds tolerance (discrepancy).				

c) For tank with an inoperative gauge.				

d) To verify pre-service differences.				

(3) Perform non-routine fuelling procedure when any one cockpit gauge is inoperative, using measuring sticks and fuel vehicle meter or measuring sticks and operative aircraft gauges, to provide a known quantity in the tank with the inoperative gauge.				

(4) Enter cockpit when a refuel panel gauge is inoperative and direct fuelling, via headphone, using operative cockpit gauge to determine tank quantity.				

(5) Perform tank to tank transfer or defuel aircraft using boost pumps, override pumps, and cross feeds when required.				

(6) Carry out overwing fuelling of pressure fuelled aircraft when required.
